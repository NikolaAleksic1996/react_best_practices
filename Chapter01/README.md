<h2>Differentiating between declarative and imperative
programming </h2>

When reading the React documentation or blog posts about React, you will have undoubtedly
come across the term **declarative**. One of the reasons why React is so powerful is that it enforces
a declarative programming paradigm

Therefore, to master React, it is essential to understand what declarative programming means
and what the main differences between imperative and declarative programming are. The easiest
way to approach this is to think about imperative programming as a way of describing how things
work, and declarative programming as a way of describing what you want to achieve.

Entering a bar for a beer is a real-life example in the imperative world, where normally you will
give the following instructions to the bartender:

1. Find a glass and collect it from the shelf.
2. Place the glass under the tap.
3. Pull down the handle until the glass is full.
4. Hand me the glass. 

In the declarative world, you would just say, “Can I have a beer, please?”

The declarative approach assumes that the bartender already knows how to serve a beer, an
   important aspect of the way declarative programming works.
